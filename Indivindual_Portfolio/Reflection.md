#### Personal Reflection on the Learning Process 

Throughout the project, I developed both technical and analytical skills while i was working across different stages of the project development. A big part of my learning process involved searching, understanding and reading carefully the documentation for tools and libraries such as Google Places API, GeoDA, Matplotlib, Searborn, and Scikit-Learn. The development of the Google Places API played a big role in my learning path as I had configure the parameters after each API request in order to bring this suitable results. This forced me to return back to the documentation and read it again more carefully and help broad my technical skills. Additionally, after creating the first visualizations, I realized some data types were not suitable for the analysis. This required me to return back preprocessing, convert variables, and rethink how the dataset was structured. Crossing between visualization and preprocessing help me to understand how important is data preperation before continuing to data visualization.

Some aspects went well, such as collecting the datasets from multiple resources, cleaning and standardizing them, and producing clear visulizations suitable for a general audience. I also become more familiar with data wrangling in order to apply machine learning as well as with spatial analysis, as I had to do an exploratory analysis for the geospatial data. 


However, some parts did not go as smoothly. Reading new documentation and implementing unfamiliar libraries required a lot of effort, and developing the machine learning pipeline was particularly challenging. Also, configuring the API requests and preproccesing was time consuming and sometimes led to dead ends.


#### Project Reflection 

The full project workflow, including data collection, preprocessing, spatial analysis, visualization and machine learning implemenentation, is well documented in the Jupyter Notebooks. Each Notebook describe step-by-step the process, code structure, analysis decisions, visual output and a reflection regarding the project goals.


#### Potential Use and Application of the Project 

The results of this project have clear societal relevance, as they show how data analysis can support a more sustainable and environment. By identifying patterns between beach ratings, trash amount, and seasonality, the results can help policymakers and environmental planners focus their cleaning efforts more efficiently, particularly during peak tourist periods. This can improve environmental quality and the public health. 

The shared datasets and notebooks allows other data scientists to build on the work and develop predictive or early-warning tools for coastal pollution. At the same time, this project highlights the importance of using data responsibly, as predictive models alone may not fully capture social or local factors influencing pollution.
