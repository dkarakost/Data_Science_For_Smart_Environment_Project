#### Personal Reflection on the Learning Process 

Throughout the project, I developed both technical and analytical skills while i was working across different stages of the project development. A big part of my learning process involved searching, understanding and reading carefully the documentation for tools and libraries such as Google Places API, GeoDA, Matplotlib, Searborn, and Scikit-Learn. Overall, working in the Jupyter Notebook environment supported iterative learning throughout the project. 

Some aspects went well, such as collecting the datasets from multiple resources, cleaning and standardizing them, and producing clear visulizations suitable for a general audience. I also become more familiar with data wrangling in order to apply machine learning as well as with spatial analysis, as I had to do an exploratory analysis for the geospatial data. 


However, some parts did not go as smoothly. Reading new documentation implementing unfamiliar libraries required a lot of effort, and developing the machine learning pipeline was particularly challenging. Also, configuring the API requests and preproccesing was time consuming and sometimes led to dead ends.


#### Project Reflection 

The full project workflow, including data collection, preprocessing, spatial analysis, visualization and machine learning implemenentation, is well documented in the Jupyter Notebooks. Each Notebook describe step-by-step the process, code structure, analysis decisions, visual output and a reflection regarding the project goals and project.


#### Potential Use and Application of the Project 

The project results can be useful for multiple audiences. Other data scientists can reuse the datasets and notebooks to continue exploring the data, improve the models, or develop more advanced predictions related to beach trash and seasonality.

Additionally, the results can be valuable for stakeholders such as policymakers and environmental planners. The insights gained from analyzing beach ratings, trash amounts, and seasonal patterns can support the development of more effective beach cleaning strategies and environmental management plans.
